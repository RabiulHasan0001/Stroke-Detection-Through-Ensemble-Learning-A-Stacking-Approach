Description: In this project, we developed a stroke prediction model using machine learning to enhance early diagnosis and treatment. The models used include Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine. A stacking ensemble approach was employed, with Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors as base models and Logistic Regression as the meta-model. After preprocessing the dataset (removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and oversampling), the stacking model achieved nearly 99% accuracy, outperforming individual models.
